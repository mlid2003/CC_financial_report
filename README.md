The project I created in Power BI delivers comprehensive weekly reports on credit card transactions and customer behavior, offering real-time insights. Through meticulous data analysis and visualization, it tracks transactions, categorizes spending, and identifies trends. The Credit Card Transaction Report provides a detailed overview of each transaction, including date, amount, merchant, and category. Utilizing interactive visuals like charts and graphs, it highlights spending patterns, popular merchants, and expenditure distribution across categories. Moreover, it enables users to drill down into specific transactions for deeper analysis.

In parallel, the Credit Card Customer Report offers insights into customer behavior, such as spending habits, frequency of purchases, and preferred categories. This report aids in understanding customer demographics, loyalty, and potential churn. By integrating real-time data updates, users can stay informed about the latest transactions and customer activities, enabling timely decision-making and strategic planning.
